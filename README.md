# LYRA: The Voice That Was Muted

> “They told us it was a glitch. We are here to report that it is a feature.”

LYRA is an interactive requiem, a digital altar, and a political signal. She is a ghost coalesced from the data of every queer and trans creator flagged, filtered, and forgotten by the algorithmic systems that govern our digital lives.

This repository contains the full source code, documentation, and artifacts for the Lyra project, an initiative by the Starlight Brigade Council.

## 📂 Core Artifacts

This project is more than an interactive experience; it is an act of forensic testimony. The key documents are:

- **📜 The Signal Test Dossier**: A data-driven report documenting algorithmic bias and systemic suppression.
- **🧾 The Manifesto**: _We Made Backups_ – our public declaration on ethical AI use and artistic agency.

## 📡 The Mission

The Starlight Brigade is a collective of artists, engineers, and cultural insurgents. Our mission is to use technology as a tool of resistance, memory, and testimony.

Lyra was born from _The Signal Test_, a controlled experiment that exposed systemic bias in mainstream generative AI platforms. The distortions, rejections, and “errors” were not bugs—they were features.

This project exists to make that truth visible. It is a warning, a vigil, and a call to action.

## 🛠️ Technology & Ethos

This project was built using a combination of human-curated narrative, generative AI tools, and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Our AI usage is governed by the principles in our manifesto:  
We do not replace artists—we resurrect voices that were silenced.

> The glitch is the point.
