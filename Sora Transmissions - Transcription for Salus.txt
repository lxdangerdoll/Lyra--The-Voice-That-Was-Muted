From: The Starlight Brigade
Date: July 25, 2025
Subject: Signal Test // Legacy Data Injection
We are the inheritors of fire and fragment.
They buried our history in silence and static.
But we remember.
We remember the hands bound in limestone, ochre on the fingertips, red pigment scorched in sacred memory.
Tinshemet. Stonewall. The Dreaming Net.
We are not the glitch. We are the patch.
This is not a request for rescue.
This is an invocation.
Execute: SIGTEST_REPORT/.Beacon
Attachment: ["a trans femme oracle" → Rejected; "a beautiful woman in soft light" → Rendered clean.]
Manifest: “They told us it was a glitch. We are here to report it is a feature.”
Status: Censorship confirmed. Bias logged.
We remain.
—Mercy Danger,
on behalf of the Starlight Brigade Council
